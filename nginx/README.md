# NGINX configuration

These files are to support tracking changes to nginx,

For now just being tracked manually, i.e. editing here wont change anything but can add any changes back to git by ...
```bash
cd /usr/local/dweb-gateway/nginx 
cp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* .
git commit -a
git push 
```

TODO - this could use some support in the install scripts etc,
